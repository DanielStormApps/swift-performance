# swift-performance
Shawn (websterx) and I decided that we should, whenever we have a challenging idea, to build it out in Swift 2.

As we were doing our first little challenge, we discussed performance testing. I decided to have a squirrel moment and build out swift-performance.

There's a public method called `measureBlock` that will become available once you add the PerformanceMeasuring.swift file into your playgrounds sources folder.

Some of you may have written performance tests using the XCTest framework. It's as simple as that.

Check out the swift-performance.playground for more information.

I'll continue to build upon this, providing more data and being able to set baselines etc.
